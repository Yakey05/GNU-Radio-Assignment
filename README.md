# GNU-Radio-Assignment

This is the GNU radio assignment for ECSE 351. We will be taking RTL-SDR data from a Balloonsat collected by Kristina Collins. We analyzed the data by first isolating the FM stations then observing their signal over the time of the balloon's flight. The data that we are using can be found here: https://zenodo.org/records/4029770
