# GNU-Radio-Assignment

This is the GNU radio assignment for ECSE 351. We will be taking RTL-SDR data from a Balloonsat collected by Kristina Collins. We analyzed the data by first isolating the FM signal then observing the signals average power over the time of the balloon's flight. The average power calculation was done on GNU-Radio and the rest of the data analysis was done using python.

The data that we are using can be found here: https://zenodo.org/records/4029770
