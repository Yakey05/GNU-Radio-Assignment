# GNU-Radio-Assignment

This is the GNU radio assignment for ECSE 351. We are trying to process and create a visual representation of RTL-SDR data from a Balloonsat collected by Kristina Collins. We analyzed the data by first isolating the FM signal(s) in the 90-92 MHz band and then observing the signal's average power over the time of the balloon's flight. The average power calculation was done on GNU-Radio and the rest of the data was processed and tabulated using python.

Data analysis and plotting was then done in Excel. Transmission Data points exceeded the time of the altitude of the data recording and so the data had to be further parsed and correlated before plotting. 

The data that we are using can be found here: https://zenodo.org/records/4029770
